# Homework Practice Submission

## This is where you will store all your homework practice.

1. You are required to commit and push your changes to your repository at the *end of every class* with the practice solutions **even if you have not completed it**
2. Organize your solutions into folders pertaining the practice topic and files named correctly with respect to the question involved.
3. This folder will be used to assess your progress in your course.  Not all the items will be marked, but some *may* be randomly chosen to.
